Yuhang Lu, YouchuanWan, Gang Li. [Scale-constrained Unsupervised Evaluation Method for Multi-scale Image Segmentation](https://cse.sc.edu/~yuhang/source/ICIP2016.pdf). IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), 2016.

### Dependency:
- Visual Studio 2013
- OpenCV 2.4

### Description:
- To evaluate the quality of image segmentation, just specify the "srcImg" and "segImg" in SegEvaluation/SegEvaluation.cpp.
- Our experimental results on BSDS500 is listed in result_BSDS.txt.
